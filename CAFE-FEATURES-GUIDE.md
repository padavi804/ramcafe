# Café Features Image Upload Guide

## How to Add Images to Your About Page Features

When you edit the About page in WordPress, you'll now see a new meta box called **"Café Feature Images"** below the main content editor.

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Go to Pages → About Us** (or whatever your About page is called)
2. **Scroll down** past the main content editor
3. **Find the "Café Feature Images" box** - it will be below the "About Page Content Settings" box
4. You'll see three sections:
   - **Feature 1: Social Connection** (image appears on the RIGHT)
   - **Feature 2: Safe & Welcoming** (image appears on the LEFT)
   - **Feature 3: Engaging Activities** (image appears on the RIGHT)

### To Upload an Image:

1. Click the **"Upload Image"** button for the feature you want to add an image to
2. Either:
   - **Upload a new image** from your computer, OR
   - **Select an existing image** from your Media Library
3. Click **"Use This Image"**
4. The image preview will appear immediately
5. Click **"Update"** or **"Publish"** to save your changes

### To Change an Image:

1. Click the **"Change Image"** button
2. Select a different image
3. Click **"Use This Image"**
4. Click **"Update"** to save

### To Remove an Image:

1. Click the **"Remove Image"** button
2. Click **"Update"** to save
3. The placeholder will reappear until you upload a new image

## Desktop vs Mobile Layout

### Desktop (screens wider than 768px):
- **Feature 1**: Text on left, Photo on right
- **Feature 2**: Photo on left, Text on right
- **Feature 3**: Text on left, Photo on right

This creates a visually appealing alternating pattern.

### Mobile (phones and small tablets):
All features stack vertically with:
- Text on top
- Photo below

This ensures readability on smaller screens.

## Image Recommendations

For best results, use images that are:
- **Minimum size**: 800px × 600px
- **Format**: JPG or PNG
- **Subject**: Photos showing people engaging in activities, socializing, or enjoying the café environment
- **Quality**: Clear, well-lit, professional-looking photos

## Tips

- The images will automatically be cropped to fit the layout
- Horizontal (landscape) photos work best
- Make sure faces are visible and the subject is clear
- Use photos that represent the spirit of each feature (connection, welcoming, activities)

## Need Help?

If the meta box doesn't appear:
1. Make sure you're using the **"About/Mission Page"** template (check Page Attributes on the right)
2. Make sure you've saved/published the page at least once
3. Try refreshing the page

**Note**: The feature text and titles can still be edited in the "About Page Content Settings" box above the image uploader.
