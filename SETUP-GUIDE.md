Our priority is to foster an environment where guests can engage in learning, joy and laughter, music and the arts, socializing, and a sense of community, understanding, and connection.

## About Page Content

### What is a Memory Café?

```
Rivers Area Memory Café offers a variety of opportunities for those impacted by memory loss. Planned activities involving movement, music and the arts, games, learning, and educational resources are available for guests to enjoy. Creating a sense of community, safety, and comfort is the foundation of this time.

The memory café program is not designed as a support group. The connection of the guests and routine of the time is designed to promote a sense of support with shared time with others facing dementia/memory loss.

Support groups feel more structured with a therapeutic/facilitated type platform—clinical and/or therapeutically led vs. socially gathered. Memory Cafés are casual, welcoming social gatherings designed to promote joy and connection.
```

### Who We Serve

```
- **Individuals with Memory Loss:** Those experiencing Alzheimer's disease, dementia, or other memory-related conditions
- **Care Partners:** Spouses, family members, friends, or professional caregivers
- **Community Members:** Anyone interested in learning more about memory care and supporting our community
- **Faith Communities and Providers:** We welcome all who want to support others impacted by memory loss
